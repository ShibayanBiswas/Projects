The objective of the project is to develop a deep learning model to identify when an article might be fake news. The attributes are id: unique id for a news article, title: the title of the news article, author: author of the news article, text: the text of the article; could be incomplete, label: a label that marks the article as potentially unreliable (1: unreliable, 0: reliable). Libraries used are Pandas, Matplotlib, Keras, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, Nltk. Here LSTM neural network is used. Accuracy is 95.00 (train more than 20 epochs)
