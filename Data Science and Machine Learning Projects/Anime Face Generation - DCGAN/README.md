The objective of the project is to Generate Anime Faces using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) with Keras and Tensorflow in Kaggle Notebook. This is an advanced deep learning project which we have to train 2 models, namely generator and discriminator. The Discriminator try to classify the images whether it is real (or) fake images. The Generator try to produce images that are close to real and fool the discriminator. Finally, the generator will produce similar images to the train dataset with different variety as output. Libraries used are Numpy, Matplotlib, Keras, TensorFlow, Nltk
