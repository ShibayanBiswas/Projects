UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset with long age span (range from 0 to 116 years old). The dataset consists of over 20,000 face images with annotations of age, gender and ethnicity. The images cover large variation in pose, facial expression, illumination, occlusion, resolution, etc. This dataset could be used on a variety of tasks, e.g, face detection, age estimation, age progression/regression, landmark localization, etc. The objective of the project is to detect gender and age using facial images. Convolutional Neural Network is used to classify the images. There are 2 output types namely, gender (M or F) and age.. Libraries used are Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Keras, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn. Gender Accuracy is 90.00 Age MAE is 6.5
