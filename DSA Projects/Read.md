Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are an important aspect of any programming language. Every language has its own data structures and its way of handling different types of algorithms. So, as a programmer, no matter what programming language you are working with, data structures and algorithms have to be an important aspect of your day-to-day programming. Thatâ€™s because we always need them to solve complex problems.
