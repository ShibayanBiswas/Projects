Data structure and Algorithm (DSA) is applied in all disciplines of software development. DSA is the building block of the software development process. It is not limited to a single programming language. Although programming languages evolve or get dormant over time, DSA is incorporated into all of these languages. The efficiency of software development depends on the choice of an appropriate data structure and algorithm. There might be cases when you are provided with the most efficient data structure to work with a robust algorithm. However, if the two are not compatible with each other, the code will not produce the expected outcome. Thus, selecting an appropriate data structure for an algorithm is an essential part of software development.
